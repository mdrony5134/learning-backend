# Node.js Concepts Learned ✅

I have learned some important Node.js concepts. Here’s a simple explanation with **real-life examples** for each topic.

---

## 1. Event Module

**Theory:**  
Node.js works in an **event-driven way**. This means things happen when an event occurs. You can listen for events and respond to them.

**Example:**  
Imagine a **restaurant**. When a customer places an order (event), the chef starts cooking (listener). If no order comes, nothing happens.

## 2. Synchronous File Read/Write

**Theory:**  
Synchronous operations happen **one after another**. The program **waits** for a task to finish before moving to the next.

**Example:**  
Think about a **bank counter**. The next customer cannot be served until the current one is finished.

---

## 3. Asynchronous File Read/Write

**Theory:**  
Asynchronous operations happen **in the background**. The program doesn’t wait and can do other tasks while the operation completes.

**Example:**  
Like **ordering food online**. You can continue doing your work while the delivery is on the way.

## 4. Buffer and Streaming

**Theory:**  
- **Buffer** is a temporary memory to store data before using it.  
- **Streaming** is sending or receiving data in **small pieces**, instead of all at once.

**Example:**  
Watching a **YouTube video**: you don’t download the entire video first. It plays **chunk by chunk** as it loads.

---

## 5. Routing

**Theory:**  
Routing is how Node.js sends different **responses for different URLs or requests**.

**Example:**  
Like a **restaurant menu**. Each page of the menu shows a different type of food: drinks page, main course page, dessert page.

---

## 6. Set Response Header

**Theory:**  
Response headers are **extra information** sent with the response. They tell the browser how to handle the data.

**Example:**  
Like **labeling a parcel**. The label says what’s inside, how fragile it is, and where it should go.

---

## 7. Todo App API

**Theory:**  
A Todo App API lets you **create, read, update, and delete tasks**. This is called **CRUD operations**.

**Example:**  
Think of a **personal task list** or **Google Keep**. You can add tasks, check them off, update them, or remove them.

---

### ✅ Summary

These Node.js concepts are the foundation for building **server-side applications**. You can:

- React to **events** with the Event Module.  
- Handle tasks **synchronously or asynchronously**.  
- Work with **large files efficiently** using buffers and streaming.  
- Serve different **pages or data** using routing.  
- Send **extra information** using response headers.  
- Build real-world APIs like a **Todo App**.
